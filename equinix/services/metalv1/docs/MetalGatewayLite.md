# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of MetalGatewayLite from a JSON string
metal_gateway_lite_instance = MetalGatewayLite.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(MetalGatewayLite.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
metal_gateway_lite_dict = metal_gateway_lite_instance.to_dict()
